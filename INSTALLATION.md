# Installation

## Pre-Requisites

1. Python - Arceus is tested using v3.8.5, but should probably work with 3.8.x.

   **IMPORTANT:** Windows users may run into issues using the Python Launcher. If you have issues installing, please try installing Python with [this guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/win/).

2. Rust - You can see an installation guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Make sure you've selected the default toolchain.
   Note: If you're on Linux, you may be able to skip this step, as manylinux wheels are pre-build and published to PyPI.

## Installing with pip

Once you have the needed pre-requisites you should just be able to install with pip:

```bash
pip install arceus
```
