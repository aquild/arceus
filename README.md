## Installation

You can read the installation instructions [here](./INSTALLATION.md).

## Usage

First, you'll need to create a `config.json`:

**IMPORTANT**: If you don't know JSON syntax, please read [this tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) and make sure your JSON is valid _before_ asking for help.

```jsonc
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "email": <ACCOUNT_EMAIL>,
      "password": <ACCOUNT_PASSWD>
    }
    ...
  ],
  "offset": <REQUEST_OFFSET>,
  "attempts": <REQUEST_ATTEMPTS>
}
```

CLI Options:

| Name         | Short |         Description |
| :----------- | :---: | ------------------: |
| `--target`   | `-t`  |       Name to snipe |
| `--config`   | `-c`  |  Config file to use |
| `--attempts` | `-a`  |    Request attempts |
| `--later`    | `-l`  | Days later to snipe |

Transfer Snipe:

```sh
arceus transfer
```

Block Snipe:

```sh
arceus block
```

## Benchmarking

CLI Options:

| Name         | Short |                  Description |
| :----------- | :---: | ---------------------------: |
| `--host`     | `-h`  |         Benchmark API to use |
| `--offset`   | `-o`  |        Request timing offset |
| `--attempts` | `-a`  |             Request attempts |
| `--delay`    | `-d`  | Seconds before the benchmark |

_Benchmarking doesn't read `config.json`, if you want to specify an offset, use the `--offset` option_

```sh
arceus benchmark
```
